# Contributing

We are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to `redux-dialog`, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Reporting Issues

Before opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/suciuvlad/redux-dialog/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.

### Bugs and Improvements

We use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.

### Submitting Issues

When submitting issues, please be as descriptive as possible. Snippets of code or small projects demonstrating the issue will help immensely when attempting to debug the issue

## Development

Clone this repo then run:
```javascript
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 to see a working example.

## Sending a Pull Request

For non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.

On the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation is to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!

In general, the contribution workflow looks like this:

- Open a new issue in the Issue tracker.
- Fork the repo.
- Create a new feature branch based off the master branch.
- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.
- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.

After you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.

Thank you for contributing!
